# Weekly Challenge 15: Graphs
# CS/MATH 113 Discrete Mathematics, Spring 2023
***

Weekly challenges (WC) invite you to critically engage with the topics covered up to that week. They may take on a variety of formats and be available and attempted through diverse platforms as the semester progresses. They may be attempted individually or in teams as indicated. If in teams, the intention is for the buddies to discuss the solution rather than split the tasks among themselves.

# Purpose

This WC requires you to think about the structure and properties of graphs. We have encountered various definitions related to graphs in class. Now we test our ability to reason about them in a novel situation.

You may need to spend a good amount of time thinking about the problems and it is unlikely that you will arrive at a solution in a single sitting. Start discussing the problem with your buddy early.

# Background

To attempt and submit the task you will need
- to know the definitions of: a simple graph, degree of a vertex in a graph
- to be familiar with sequences
- the time and persistence to think over the problem
- comfort with GitHub and LaTeX

# Task and Submission

The task for this WC is explained in the accompanying prompt which is to be compiled in LaTeX. You will enter your solution in the indicated space(s) in the same file. Make sure to include any supporting files needed for successful compilation. The same file at the time of the submission deadline will be taken to be your submission.

# Grading

The score earned by your submission will be assigned to the team assuming that the buddies contributed equally. To confirm, teams will be occasionally called in for a viva on their submission. If any of the members is unable to explain the submission or does not appear for the scheduled viva, _the team_ will lose marks not only for that WC but for previous WCs in which they were awarded marks based on trust. You are encouraged to report non-contributing buddies through the [appropriate form](https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/2619/quizzes/7186).

# Deadline and discussion

_Deadline_: 2350h on Sun, 23 Apr
